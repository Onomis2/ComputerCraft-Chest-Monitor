# ComputerCraft-Chest-Monitor

This is a simple program for computercraft that checks for a chest and a monitor connected to a pc and then displays whatever is in the chest onto the monitor.

# How to install
1. In minecraft, place a pc and next to it, place a chest and a monitor. The monitor and pc can be either standard or advanced, it does not influence functionality.
2. Copy the code below and run it inside the PC:
```
wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Onomis2/ComputerCraft-Chest-Monitor/main/install.lua
```
3. Fill the chest and watch the program do it's job.

# Notes
When adding new monitors while the program is already running, text will not center again. The best solution is to turn the pc off and on again after adding more monitors.
